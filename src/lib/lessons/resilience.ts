A retry with the same key and fingerprint replays P-901; it does not charge again. Reusing the key for amount 70.00 is rejected as a fingerprint conflict.

    decision: "Retry the payment POST only with the original key and identical semantic payload, and make the provider call using a stable corresponding key; reject key reuse with a different payload.",
    reasoning: [
      "The timeout bounds the caller's wait; it does not establish whether the provider committed the charge.",
      "A fresh key would describe a new logical operation and could create another payment.",
      "The server must durably associate the original key, a canonical request fingerprint, and an outcome or in-progress state before permitting a retry to start another effect.",
      "If the same key arrives concurrently, coordination must prevent both requests from initiating an independent charge; a later request can wait, replay, or receive a documented in-progress response.",
      "A different fingerprint under the same key is a conflict, not a cache hit: silently replaying would conceal a changed user intent.",
      "The API's retention must cover realistic retry/reconciliation delays. After expiry, the old key may no longer protect against duplication, so the client must reconcile payment state rather than assume it is safe to resend.",
      "A status GET may be repeated but can return changed information over time; idempotent mutation semantics do not mean every read has an invariant response.",

  contrast: [{ alternative: "Use a natural business key such as orderId as the unique payment identity", tradeoff: "A database uniqueness constraint can be simple and durable for a strictly one-payment-per-order rule, but it cannot represent legitimate multiple attempts or partial captures without a richer domain identity. An explicit idempotency key separates one client-intended operation from later operations.", whenNotToUse: "Do not add a client key as a substitute for an existing authoritative uniqueness invariant when the domain truly permits only one payment per order; enforce that invariant transactionally and define how legitimate retries map to it." }],

    { wrong: "A timeout means the payment did not happen, so a new request is safe.", discriminant: "Ask what evidence distinguishes caller timeout from provider commit state.", counterexample: "The provider commits P-901 and its response is lost. A request with a new key can commit P-902 and charge the same order again." },
    { wrong: "An idempotency key makes all requests with that key equivalent forever.", discriminant: "Compare payload fingerprint, operation type, concurrency, and retention policy.", counterexample: "The same key is reused with amount 70.00 instead of 64.20, or retried after the 24-hour record expired; neither case should be silently treated as the original safe replay." },
